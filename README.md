# Topic:Code challenge: The Bot Battlr

# Purpose
To complete the code challenge assigned by creating a bot web app


# Setting up the enviroment
Set up the coding environment through these steps:
 1. Create a github repository for the assignment.
 2. Create a directory for the assignments.(mkdir folder name)
 3. Create three files each for working on the three questions.(touch file.txt)
 4. Get started on the assignments.


# Structure
The structure of this directory is as follows:
1. node modules
2. public
3. src
4. eslintcache
5. gitignore
6. db.json
7. package-lock.json
8. package.json
9. README.md


# What to do
In this code challenge, a bot web app is created with the core functionalities like displaying a collection of bots, adding bots to your bot army, removing bots from your bot army and deleting bots from the bot collection and the backend server.



# Working through errors
The codes should be run through the browser by running the command 'npm start' to start the project on the browser and running the command 'json-server --watch db.json' to display data from the db.json file to confirm everything is working and check the console in order to confirm whether the codes are working.If they are not working, the console should display the errors in the codes which should give clues on how to rectify the errors.


# Submitting work done
After finishing the code challenge, the following should be done:
1. Save your changes
2. Link your local repository with your remote repository(git remote add origin).
3. Add your files(git add .)
4. Commit your changes(git commit -m "message")
5. Push your changes to the remote repository(git push origin branch name)

After finishing these steps you should see your updates changes in your github profile.
 
Before we forget,the work is to be submitted to canvas. Simply paste the URL of the work in the submission section of the code challenge and click on submit assignment.

That's pretty much it! The code challenge has been successfully completed and submitted!
